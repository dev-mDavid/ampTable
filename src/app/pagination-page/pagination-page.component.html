  <h2>Pagination</h2>
  <h3>How I would handle pagination?</h3>
  <p>
    I didn't implement pagination into this project yet. This is how I would do it with ClickUp's API. For example, we'll use Get Tasks as the Http request. 
    <br><br>
    To paginate my table: I would create a function that dynamically creates the Http request (using page as the parameter). I would bind this function to a button click. Most likely create several buttons that paginate to different page requests. 
    <br><br>
    If we want to alter how many show on each render, I would create a select pagination-amount button. Dynamically take the amount-of-objects from the a single page-request and divide them by the pagination-amount. Then show the available pagination options. 
  </p>

  <h2>Search & Filter</h2>
  <h3>How I would build a more robust search & filter system?</h3>
  <p>
    This project specified that the search was to be done client-side and not through filtering via the Http Get request. I built something modest with semi-original code. 
    <br> <br>
    If I were to create a feature for production. I would allow filtering via the Http Request and then use commercial-grade search database service (ie Alogia, ElasticSearch, Meilisearch). This search database service would index all property values of the Get Requests. And then I would build in the Angular components to call those proper search services.
